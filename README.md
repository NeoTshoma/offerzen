## Suggestions

* It would help if we knew if the navbar and search bar stick to the top or not.
* Regarding the search, it would be helpful to know if we should delay the search with something like a debounce or not.
* Should the search be on full character basis? Or should it be similar to the one I created?

`Around 5 hours, the section where I spend the most time was task A due to the fact that I had to setup the Ngrx store and services.`
